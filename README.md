Restaurant Name Generator is an interactive web application that leverages artificial intelligence to create creative restaurant names and matching menu items. Users simply select a cuisine type (Indian, Italian, Mexican, Arabic, or American) and the AI generates a unique restaurant name along with relevant menu suggestions. Built with Streamlit for the frontend and LangChain for AI integration, this tool is perfect for aspiring restaurant owners, creative writers, or anyone looking for culinary inspiration.
